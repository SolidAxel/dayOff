# dayOff
Which day(s) of the week should you take off for max holidays off?
## Goal
---
This is a (hopefully) small personal project to learn a little bit of Rust. The final aim of this project is to allow the user to see what day(s) of the week they should request as not available to work in order to receive the most holidays off that aren't already given off.

## Functionality
---
1. User is asked what year they're interested in.
2. User is asked whether they are already given weekends off.
3. User is asked which holidays their employers does not give them off.
4. Program outputs 1st and 2nd days of the week with most holidays landing on it.
