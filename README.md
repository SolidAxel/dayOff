# dayOff
Which day(s) of the week should you take off for max holidays off?
## Goal
---
This is a hopefully small personal project to learn a little bit of Rust. The final aim of this project is to allow the user to see what day(s) of the week they should request as not available to work in order to receive the most holidays off that aren't alrady given off.
## Crates Used

* chrono
* bdays
